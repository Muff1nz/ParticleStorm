# ParticleStorm
Lots of particles boi, c++, vulkan

# Broad plan going forward (24.09.2019):
## Rendering:
  - Finish RenderEngine improvements, mostly textures remaining.
  - Implement system for memory management in Vulkan (to handle dynamic rendering better)
  - Some cool graphical effects, 2D lighting for instance, gravity waves, anything!
  - Ensure that the render engine will work on a wide array of GPUs
## GUI:
  - Create a font engine
  - Create GUI Components
  - Create menus
## Physics:
  - Implement remaining physics stuff, mostly genetic hyper parameters
  - Make the simulation more well behaved (Some issues: Sticky particles in overhangs, sudden explosion chain effects)
  - More toys, currently only have explosions
  - Variable particle radiuses, and dynamic particle counts during runtime (Toggleable depending on performance)
## Input Handling:
  - Creat a proper input handler
## Audio:
 - Anything (probably ability to playa song in background)
